## About

Can belly-button bacteria be used to create tasty alternatives to beef? In this project, we took data from a study on belly-button bacteria and presented it visually as shown below. In it, we gathered the data from a JSON file, processed it using JavaScript, and presented it using different methods with Plotly. Using the drop-down menu on the left, a subject ID can be elected and the information on the page will be updated with information for that ID. The bar chart lists the most frequent bacteria for the subject in descending order, the gauge chart shows how frequently the subject washes their belly button, and the bubble chart provides a robust display of the frequency of bacteria strains against others. The information found here could be useful in showing the variety of bacteria found in the human belly button.
